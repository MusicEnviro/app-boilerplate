# boilerplate for MusicEnviro React apps

## usage

* copy and rename this directory
* git init
* npm init (for one thing it renames the package)
* (this step should not be necessary it was already done to the boilerplate)
rm -rf node_modules && rm package-lock.json && npm i  (otherwise it doesn't find scripts, or something)
* alter this readme
